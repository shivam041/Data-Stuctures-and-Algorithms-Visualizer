Algorithm Visualizer
A dynamic, interactive web application that visualizes common data structures and algorithms. This tool helps users understand how different algorithms work through step-by-step visual representations.
 
Features
•	Interactive Visualizations for:
•	Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
•	Searching Algorithms (Binary Search)
•	Data Structures (Linked List, Binary Tree)
•	Multi-Language Support
•	Java
•	Python
•	Real-Time Animation Controls
•	Play/Pause functionality
•	Speed adjustment
•	Step-by-step progression
•	Reset capability
•	Code Display
•	Syntax highlighting
•	Editable code snippets
•	Language-specific implementations
Technologies Used
Frontend
•	React.js
•	D3.js for visualizations
•	CSS3 for styling
Development Tools
•	Vite
•	Node.js
•	npm
Getting Started
